# Vision
Music Typing is a typing game based on typing song lyrics. The goal is to give players a resource to learn the proper typing hand position and to be able to practice typing in a fun way. The game requires players to type the stanzas of a song before the next one as the song is playing. This can make practice more fun, with players being able to type something that is familiar and interesting, while giving room to increase challenge by using a faster song. The players are scored based on their average wpm and accuracy at the end of the song.
